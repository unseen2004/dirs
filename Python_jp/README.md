## Overview
**Python_jp** is designed for developers interested in experimenting with Japanese language features and creating applications that leverage Japanese keywords and syntax. It provides:
- A command-line interface for running scripts.
- A preprocessor to handle custom language syntax.
- Translation utilities to convert between standard Python and the Japanese variant.
- Exception handling and utilities to ease development.

---

## Features
- **CLI Tool:** Run your `*.jppy` scripts directly.
- **Preprocessor:** Transform custom syntax into standard Python code.
- **Translator & Runner:** Convert and execute your code seamlessly.
- **Modular Design:** Organized as a standard Python package for easy integration.

## Installation

### From Source
Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python_jp.git
cd Python_jp
```

Install via setup.py:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

Alternatively, if using pip:
```bash
pip install python-jp
```

### Using the Executable
The `bin/python_jp` script provides a command-line interface for running `.jppy` scripts. Make sure it’s added to your PATH or run it directly from the repository.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface
After installation, you can run your custom `.jppy` files using the CLI tool. For example:
```bash
python_jp run examples/hello_world.jppy
```

### Examples
- **hello_world.jppy:**
  This example demonstrates the basic usage of Python_jp.

- **test.jppy:**
  A sample script for testing various features of the framework.

Open the files in the `examples/` directory to see sample code and usage patterns.
